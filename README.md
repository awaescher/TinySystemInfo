# TinySystemInfo

A dependency free package that gathers just the absolute basic system metrics on Linux, macOS and Windows.

|Operating system|Meta info|Cpu usage|Memory usage|
|-|-|-|-|
|Linux|âœ… `/etc/os-release`|ðŸŸ¨ `top` Seems too low|âœ… `/proc/meminfo`|
|macOS|âœ… `sw_vers`|âœ… `top`|ðŸŸ¨ `sysctl` Incorrect, calculated from memory pressure|
|Windows|âœ… `System.Environment`|ðŸŸ¨ `PerformanceCounter("% Processor Time")` Seems too low|âœ… `GlobalMemoryStatusEx()`|

## Usage

Install `TinySystemInfo` from NuGet and simply call `TinySystemReader.Read()`.
